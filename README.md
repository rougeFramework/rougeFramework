#What is it ?

rougeFramework is meant to provide a foundation for small custom apps, bridging the gap between specialized solutions (blogs, portfolios…) and full-fledged (but completely barebone) frameworks.

-   Design generator (with realtime color, fonts and ratio edition)
-   Easy data models generations (with built-in data associations)

-   Automatic routing
-   Wysiwyg main navigation editor
-   Authentication
-   Built-in webpack optimisation (and post-css transpiling)
-   Zero configuration built-in database and dev server
    And more to come…

# What is it built with ?

This is a 100% js framework

-   Server-side : NodeJs and ExpressJs
-   Client-side : VueJs
-   Templating : Pug
-   Packaging : webpack
-   Database : lowdb
-   Testing : Jest & Cypress

# Neat ! How do I install it

rougeFramework is not quite yet ready. Expect an Alpha by the end of 2019

(yet… you may clone the repo, run npm install then npm run start:dev. But I'd recommend you to wait a little bit ;))
